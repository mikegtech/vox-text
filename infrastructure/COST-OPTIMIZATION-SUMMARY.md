- ✅ **Regional Endpoint**: Standard AWS infrastructure
- ✅ **Lambda Authorizer**: Pay-per-use security
- ✅ **Direct Internet Access**: No network complexity
- ✅ **Standard Pricing**: $3.50 per million requests

### **Security Model:**
- 🔐 **Lambda Authorizer**: Validates Telnyx signatures
- 🔐 **KMS Encryption**: Customer-managed keys for all data
- 🔐 **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access
- 🔐 **CloudWatch Logging**: Full request/response logging

## 📈 **Cost Scaling**

### **Request Volume Impact:**
| Monthly Requests | API Gateway Cost | Lambda Cost | Total Additional |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1,000 | $0.004 | $0.20 | $0.20 |
| 10,000 | $0.035 | $2.00 | $2.04 |
| 100,000 | $0.350 | $20.00 | $20.35 |
| 1,000,000 | $3.500 | $200.00 | $203.50 |

### **Usage-Based Benefits:**
- **Low Traffic**: Very low costs for development/testing
- **Predictable Scaling**: Costs scale linearly with usage
- **No Fixed Infrastructure**: No monthly VPC endpoint fees

## 🎯 **Comparison: Before vs After**

### **Before (With VPC Endpoint):**
```
Development:  $5.74 + $7.30 = $13.04/month
Production:   $23.35 + $7.30 = $30.65/month
Annual Total: $525.24/year
```

### **After (Public API):**
```
Development:  $5.74/month
Production:   $23.35/month
Annual Total: $348.84/year
```

### **Annual Savings: $176.40**
